# How to make a Zettel entry

This is the body of the Zettel (which means "slip")

* First bullet
* Second bullet
* ... 

But, when I have an ordered or numbered list :

1. First
2. Second
3. ... 

What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic*** ?

How about something that look like `code` ?

In GoLang :

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.PrintIn("Hello World !")
}
```

And when I have a URL I want it to print also so I always write it out like this : 

https://rwx.gg

* I put references at the bottom
